# Description
NanoBud is a simple electronic project created for workshops into FabLabs.
Basically this project is provided with "Space Invaders" retro game made by makestuffordie.
With simple electronic components you can make some great stuffs.
But you can use it not only for gaming. 
Per example, replace the rotary encoder by a temperature sensor, load the suitable arduino sketch, then you have a beautiful portable weather station!

With this project you can do a workshop and show people how to assembly electronic components and get perfect welds. 
Please visit the wiki to get the workshop kit. -> [Wiki](https://github.com/fablabs-ch/nanobud/wiki)

But not only, if you want go further and make different kind of workshops, here some quick ideas:
- How to load and programm Arduino boards
- How to manage oled screen.
- Design your own case for 3D print or 2D Lasercut.

As you understood, the only limit is your creativity. :-)

Enjoy and don't hesitate to share your experiences.

# Hardware
## Material
- 1x Rotary encoder
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 1x OLED screen 0.96" 128x64pix
- 1x micro switch
- 1x 9V Battery
- 1x 9V  to wire adapter
- 1x Buzzer
- 1x Resistor 100 Ohms
- 1x Pinheader female 1x4
- 2x Pinheader female 1x15

## PCB
Two designs are provided for pcbs printing. 
You can print only one PCB or you can get the panelization and order many pcb at once. 
It will reduce the production costs.

# Software
It's actually using the sketch from makestuffordie but improvements or differents applications would be appreciated.
Don't hesitate participate to the project.
